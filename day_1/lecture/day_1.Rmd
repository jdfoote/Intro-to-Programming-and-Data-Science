## Introductions

## Dad Joke

- Why did the nearsighted man fall in the well?

> - He couldn't see that well!

# The Class


## Programming provides exciting opportunities for social scientists

> - Digital data is exploding and programming is required to do research at scale
> - Algorithms mediate more and more interactions and understanding programming can help us to analyze them
> - Computational methods let us do new things
>	- Natural language processing
>	- Simulation
>	- Large-scale experiments
> - There is value in "thinking like a computer"

## Goals

> - Learn basic programming
> - Collect data using APIs
> - Perform basic visualizations using Pandas
> - Learn about fundamental computational social science techniques
> - Read and evaluate computational social science research
> - Meaningfully progress a research project that uses computation

## This is an intense class intended to teach the basics of skills used by computational social scientists

> - But we can do it!
> - Module 1: Python for Everybody
> - Module 2: Pandas, visualizations, and APIs
> - Module 3: Data cleaning, version control, etc.
> - Module 4: Work on final project

## Day-to-day

> - Lecture
>	- Recorded lecture on coding topic
>	- Notebook to follow along - download and run each day
>	- Class time focused on confusions + Coding Challenges
> - Coding Challenges
>	- Random "cold calling" for reviewing solutions
> - Example paper
>	- One person will present each Thursday + lead discussion
>	- Others will be prepared to discuss
> - Co-working

## Readings

> - Getting kind of stale
>   - Help me find new things to read!
> - Sign up to present twice on Google Spreadsheet
>   - Present the work as though you were the researcher
>   - Everyone else will skim and be prepared to ask questions

## Coding Challenges

> - Exercises from the book
> - Jupyter Notebooks
> - Suggested approach:
>	- Work with a partner
> - Use AI (ChatGPT, Github Copilot, Claude, etc)
>     - Make sure you understand the result!
>	- Ask questions on Element
>	- Look up solutions (where available)

## Coding Challenge Reviews

> - The coldcaller will choose someone to share in class
> - Do you want solutions posted as well? We can use Element rooms


## Final Project

> - Default option
>	- Jupyter notebook
>	- Short intro + Methods + Result section of paper
> - Replication
> - Do what is best for your future goals
>   - Let's meet if you have questions

## Project Milestones

> - Final project
>	- Identify a dataset and general plan (September 5)
>	- Project planning doc (October 15)
>	- Project presentation + report (December 3 and 5)

## Grades

> - Goal is learning
> - Two self-assessment reflections

# Resources

## Wiki

> - Schedule
> - Links to readings
> - Slides and videos may be from older versions of the class
>	- I will try to stay 1-2 weeks ahead

## Brightspace

> - Readings
> - Example Projects
> - Announcements

## Element

> - Post questions and help each other
> - Post solutions to homework problems

## Anaconda / VSCode Intro
