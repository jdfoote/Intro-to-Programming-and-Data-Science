"Not a doctor, but here are my thoughts.
Definitely see someone and ASAP. Do you have access to the images from your past brain injury? Start trying to get them, if possible. It will be really important for your new provider to understand the past issue in order to evaluate this potential issue.  

Neurologists around here are scheduling several months out, so seeing a provider at PUSH, an urgent care, or an ER is a good place to start. 

Don‚Äôt resume workouts (or any other activity that might put stress on your upper spine/neck) until you‚Äôre medically cleared to do so. The risk isn‚Äôt worth it.",0,4,Purdue,4,0,1731326648.0,600

"A little reality check here. 99% chance it isn't gonna happen unless you've got an influential family member who can pull strings to land you one as a freshman (or even sophomore).

Internships don't usually happen until you're a junior in college. Then the companies use that as your interview to see if they'll hire you after you graduate as a senior. If you're really interested in getting into semiconductors, take classes related to it and see if you can work with a professor who does semiconductor research. But, a professor normally won't let anyone work with them in their lab until they know you... So, my advice is, get in, kick ass in your classes and show that you're determined and want to learn more.

You can do this by joining societies like IEEE and ACM become active in them and become an officer in them. This will let you start to network and meet folks from various companies and start to meet professors on campus. Networking is the name of the game.

Here's another thing: What caliber of assistants could you attract to a situation where Walters would begin the season on the hot seat and face a schedule like ours in '25? 

Then there's possible roster attrition. Players are bound to leave. If subpar talent is the issue some will be shown the door. If dissatisfaction is an issue some will seek the door. Then there's the Hail Mary of grabbing portal players in order to win now to save his job.

There was no reason for a 4-8 team looking to repeat the same record to sell out season tickets, so I'm sure it was just the home schedule that influenced it.

Ohio State, USC, and IU (if they keep Cig) will be the only big home games next season. If USC is scheduled after mid-October, I doubt that would drive many sales (since USC will be in its usual mid-season collapse and won't travel for that game).",1,4,Purdue,4,0,1731338700.0,599

Instead, they need to find the players in the portal from G5, FCS, and even D2-3 schools. They've been playing significant minutes and are outperforming at their current level. There's tape and evidence of what they can produce now, and with the right coaching (especially S&C coaching), they can perform at the P4 level. That's what Cig has been able to do at IU.

Today: Rutgers (-15.5) vs St. Peter‚Äôs (-106 FD). 3 units. 

Line is -16 at DK, I just like Rutgers‚Äô talent in this one. Two freshmen studs and some senior leadership behind them will make the Scarlet Knights a contender in the Big Ten.

"Season record: 13-7 +7.05U - good slate but lines are jumping around like crazy. I missed McNeese at 20.5 running errands already, as well as losing a bit of juice on the Kansas City TT over. Yale at 17.5, etc., need to be a little sharper and get my lazy ass up before 5am.

Chattanooga -3.5 (-105)1U

Mercer +9 (-112) 0.5U

Mercer TT O80.5(+200) 0.5U -- This game is going to be interesting. The Mercer coach, Ryan Ridder is the former Tenn Martin and Bethune Cookman coach. 5 out of his 6 years of coaching, his teams ranked top 25 in the nation in tempo, as high as 3rd and 7th two years. Virginia Lynchburg isn't a D1 opponent but they dropped 125 on them 4 days ago...they put up 87 shots. Holtmann on the other hand has always had teams that play quite slow but DePaul has shot 30+ threes in both of their games so far. We could see 70 threes here tonight.

Hawaii 3.5 (-110)1U -- running it back again tonight with this one. A new coach and team for Pacific this year but I just don't buy it yet.",0,2,sportsbook,2,0,1731341945.0,1036

Furthermore, they paused serving the food for half an hour just for dj. They legit told at one point please move from the line to attend the dj. First of all, who puts DJ amidst catering going on. And don't get me started on the line management. At the end of the line, a huge blob of people can be seen. It's not that hard to maintain a queue. Given you have VIP passes and those other priority criteria, you could have let those people in a separate line so that others don't suffer. Otherwise I don't see a point of doing RSVP where you only get a little bit of paneer after standing in an hour long queue.

"Hey guys! We apologise if your experience with us wasn‚Äôt what you guys were looking forward to. We as a club wanted to give you all a feel of being back home and celebrate Diwali with all us. Our team has worked immensely on this event throughout the entire semester. Managing a 1300+ people at an event with free food tends to be chaotic. We all were trying our best to coordinate with all of you guys. Pushing over the staff/board members for food who‚Äôs been working so hard for all of you guys is very uncivilised. Bullying the staff, spitting on their faces and overall harsh comments were very disappointing and disheartening. As for VIPs, its one of our perks of the membership and they have been promised a priority by us which we stand by. Misuse of the VIP passes and its management is something out of our control at times which got even worse due to the chaos at the lines. We tried to control it by removing the bands once they received food so they can‚Äôt come for seconds. Overall our team put its best efforts out there today to manage the best we could. Those of you who had fun we are so glad to host this event for all of you guys and for those who had a bad experience, hope you guys have fun at our future event and give us a chance to do what we wanted to do for all of you guys.

Do you think Purdue contacts the food vendors and DJs? No, that‚Äôs the hard work CASO did to make it happen. Organizing such a huge event takes a lot of time and effort, especially as a student, and they did it for you.

As of this week, 6 of Georgia's games are rated as more difficult than any game on Indiana's schedule, and 3 of them rated as 24+ points more difficult, which is an enormous difference.

Essentially, big wins make lower ratings less likely and higher ratings more likely, while tough losses may only decrease likelihood at the highest ratings.  What the model sees is that Georgia has won one of the most difficult game of any team this year - which is a strong indicator of quality, even if they have dropped two other equally difficult games.  

On the flip side, Indiana has won all of their games, but without a marquee win, the model still sees it as quite likely that a good (but not elite) team would be undefeated against their record.

Here's a subset of the likelihood calculations at some key Net Ratings:

Rating | [Georgia](#f/georgia) | [Indiana](#f/indiana)
| -----: | -----: | -----:
40 | 1.27 | 4.36
35 | 4.44 | 10.73
30 | 9.69 | 21.51
25 | 12.99 | 33.87
20 | 10.15 | 38.88
15 | 4.41 | 30.15
10 | 1.05 | 14.64

What matters is the likelihoods relative to each other.  And we see Georgia's rating range as more focused around the +25 mark, while Indiana still has a very wide range of likelihoods.  For example, Georgia is 10x more likely to be a +25 than a +40, while for Indiana its only about 8x more likely to be a +25 than a +40.  On the lower end though, Georgia is 12x more likely to be a +25 than a +10, while Indiana is only about 2.3x more likely to be a +25 than a +10.

in more layman's terms - to the model, Georgia's win on the road against an elite level team has proven that they themselves are in that top tier, while Indiana *could* be, but its also relatively likely they are just a good team on a heater against a pretty soft schedule.",0,2,CFB,2,0,1731287728.0,3582
"Tulane played #21 KSU and #31 Oklahoma (lost to both), and won the rest of their games fairly easily. Tulane is ranked #33. 

Louisiana played... Tulane (lost to them) and then beat a bunch of teams no better than those Tulane played, but is ranked ahead of Tulane at #28.

Not mad (computers don't know what they're doing), but definitely curious how that happens, when they have the same number of wins, Tulane only has one more loss (but against higher ranked teams), but Tulane beat Louisiana head-to-head on the field (at Louisiana too).",0,3,CFB,3,0,1731300127.0,542

The way you describe it seems identical to Strength of Resume. 

>it measures how much better than the average team we should expect a team to be, given ONLY its win/loss record against its schedule.

Now, things obviously get squirrelly when you talk about thr underlying systems, but that's not what really matters, right?   Like if we slapped FPI in instead of SRS, what's the difference between what you're doing here and that?   Obviously FPI utilizes recruiting rankings and preseason rankings, but we could find a dozen systems out there that rate teams based on only on field performance that are better than SRS to slap in the under-carriage here.

"Well said Tony.  I'm also pretty high on the Illini this year (alumni biased aside).  However, my big question for this team will be if they can squash the ""young, inexperienced"" freshmen narrative.  On paper, this team looks to be on the younger end of the spectrum with 3 of their main contributors shaping up to be true freshmen.  I believe this team will need to rely heavily on the experience from guys like Humrichous, White, and Boswell to guide this team through a long and taxing regular season.  Any avid college basketball fan is well aware how difficult it is to win on the road, and winning on the road in the B1G is that much more challenging.  Adding road games at cross country arenas like Oregon, USC, UCLA, and Washington throws an added travel wrinkle into an already difficult Big Ten regular season schedule.  

I have nothing but compliments for Brad Underwood.  I'm sure we will create a thread at some point this year discussing how BU has transformed this program, but he has made Illini basketball a nationwide brand by concocting a non-conference schedule of high profile games, including 3 matchups with Top 25 perennials prior to conference play.  This non-con schedule also includes a Turkey Day matchup with the Coach Cal led Razorbacks from Fayatteville, as well as a February showdown with Duke at MSG.  Not only does this help the current roster get battle tested for conference play and a tournament run in March, but has to do wonders on the recruiting trail.  

  
I'm looking forward to this college hoops season and contributing content to this thread.  Buckle up and enjoy the ride!!

If you‚Äôre genuinely asking, then unironically yes. There was a lot more optimism around the 1-4 spots coming into this year than the 5 spot. Sorry for the ensuing wall of text.

Our options are:

* ~~Jacobsen, a true freshman with insane height, but even less weight & strength than Haarms had when he was on our squad. Started to get optimistic seeing his shooting and offense in the offseason, exhibition games, and our opener, but even then you could still see him being bullied due to the lack of size/strength.~~
* TKR, who was already our starting 4, though some fans would like to see how he fares in the dedicated 5 slot.
* Furst, who our fanbase generally lost faith in over the course of last year. Just seemed to quietly lose the hype we had for him, though I do think he can still step up and play well for us.
* Burgess, a true freshman. Plenty of reason to hope he can develop into a great big, especially if his conditioning and skills can match the strength in the paint he‚Äôs supposed to bring.
* Berg, who started to get some favor in the fanbase towards the end of last year from garbage time minutes and is kind of already losing said favor after the first two games we‚Äôve played. (Maybe our fanbase is just a little impatient lol.)",2,9,CollegeBasketball,9,0,1731297350.0,1371

"Without that spot figured out we're basically a recent Fran team to me. We'll still have elite scoring with Smith, Loyer, TKR able to go off consistently and other great shooters to plug in around them. But it might suddenly look different against really good defenses and our defense could be pretty suspect the whole year. Should still definitely be a tournament team imo. The hope is that this might force Painter into some more versatile lineups that could have really high ceilings, e.g. Heide at the 4 (despite the current funk he seems to be going through) or a Furst alongside TKR which I think actually has looked really really good defensively in the past",2,8,CollegeBasketball,8,0,1731278998.0,665

The exact questions you asked on your post.,2,8,FAFSA,8,0,1731262884.0,43
"Where do you see that there is 6k left? That information is not in your screenshot. 

When you sign up for classes, you are billed for those classes. If you live on campus, and/or have a meal plan, you're also billed for those costs. These, and any other school related costs (like mandatory fees) get compiled into a bill. That bill total amount is the same as your net cost.

This bill amount gets paid for first by financial aid. If financial aid doesn't cover everything, you are left with a balance. If it covers everything perfectly, you have no balance but no refund. If it covers that cost and MORE, you get a refund.

No matter what, though, the bill has to be paid. In your case, your financial aid covered everything and then some. That is why you are getting a refund.

Financial aid is dispersed in each semester. You may currently have a bill for spring because that semester has not started, but you don't need to worry about that right now because your school knows you get financial aid and will wait until it is dispersed to ask for money *if* you owe anything after your financial aid is paid. If your financial aid is more than your net cost again in the spring, you will again get a refund.

If you still do not understand, please talk to your financial aid office.",2,1,FAFSA,1,0,1731284700.0,1286
"Net cost isn't a bill. It's how much your ""cost"" is. Your cost was covered by your grants and scholarships, but it still ""cost"" (not directly to you) that much.

The cost doesn't go away because it was paid.

Yes, if you keep getting the same grants/scholarships you will keep getting refunds.

No, you don't have to pay it back unless any of the money you're getting is a loan *or* if you do something that triggers a repayment to one of those grants/scholarships. For example (this is just an example, I didn't look anything up here, it's just from my own experience) if one scholarship from your school says your GPA has to remain above a 3.0 to keep getting it, and that if you fall below that you forfeit it, they may want repayment of that money for the semester in which your GPA dropped below the 3.0. They also may just stop giving you the money for future terms and not care about the money they've already dispersed. It depends on the scholarship/grant.",2,0,FAFSA,0,0,1731262045.0,964

"Not the same.

SEC defenses are 3-4, where the linebackers play a large role filling gaps in the 3 man front.

Jim Knowles is closer to a modified 4-2-5, where one of the DEs is a rushing LB, and you rely on a 3rd safety for run support.

This doesn't work well when the opponent runs up the gut. This makes the rushing LB over shoot the play, then there's really only two bodies at the second level to pick up the gaps on the 3 man front.",2,0,OhioStateFootball,0,0,1731267736.0,439

I know, I know.  UCS at 5?  But this based on on-field data ONLY, not wins/losses.  UCS has put up respectable on-field statistics, they just can't close out games.  That tells me that problem there is culture, leadership, coaching.  Much like Nebraska.  That seems to be a common theme with blood blue has-beens struggling to stay relevant, we are seeing it with Oklahoma now, too.

So, if the question is ""5th best team,"" the statistical answer I've got is USC.  If the question is ""5th best resume"" ... oi vey.  *Probably* Iowa?  The Hawks destroyed a decent-but-not-awesome Minnesota team on the road and are demolishing teams at home, close losses on the road in weird games, and they really should have beaten an Iowa State team that, despite recent struggles, is pretty solid.

But there's a huge gap statistically after Indiana.  There is a clear 4-team top tier, a 2-team bottom tier, and then a lot of meh in the middle.

\[Edit: I'll second those who say UCLA.  Their losses are to: Indiana, LSU, Oregon, Penn State, and Minnesota.  None of those are terrible losses, though the Minnesota loss was at home.  I've got the Bruins with a decent shot at making a bowl game and they could draw an inside straight to go 7-5 (about a 9% chance).

Choosing schoolü´°ü´°

Help choose

Good evening you all,

So, I got an offer from Purdue for the Computing Systems Analysis and Design major‚Äînot Cybersecurity, likely because they didn‚Äôt have space for me. Does anyone know the likelihood of transferring to Cybersecurity in the fall?

Aside from that, I also got offers from Ohio State University and UMass Amherst, both for Computer Science. OSU took all my military credits (mostly electives, but still helpful), while UMass didn‚Äôt accept any of them. Just a heads-up for my fellow veterans/military folks.ü´†ü´†ü´†

I have a couple of backup offers from Rutgers University and Indiana University Bloomington, which also offered me CS. 


I‚Äôm planning to use my GI Bill for whichever I choose.

UMD only offered me admission to Letters and Sciences, saying I didn‚Äôt meet the gateway requirements. After doing some research, it looks almost impossible to transfer into my desired program there, so that one‚Äôs off my list.

Looking for advice on which school is worth it or which I should go with. Thanks!

Is there anything in particular you‚Äôd like to know about OSU? It‚Äôs hard to evaluate if OSU is ‚Äúworth it‚Äù without knowing what you‚Äôre looking for. OSU has some advantages over Purdue in terms of being in a bigger city where there‚Äôs more to do and more companies based here. OSU also boasts the largest living alumni network in the world.,0,5,OSU,5,0,1731249664.0,336

I‚Äôm mainly focused on cybersecurity and aiming to become an Information Security Officer for the Navy or work in security for a federal agency.",1,1,OSU,1,0,1731249877.0,418
"I learned the hard way that a computer science degree is very different from a cybersecurity degree. For the first 4-5 semesters, none of the classes are cybersecurity related. You have to learn foundational topics like writing software with Java, analyzing the run time of different algorithms, low-level coding for operating systems.

Computer Networks is the first cyber-related class, and it‚Äôs usually taken by juniors. CSE 4471, Intro to Information Security, is a look at Information Security concepts and theory (almost completely non-technical). CSE 5472, Information Security Projects, which is for fourth years and up, is where you finally get to do some cybersecurity labs. CSE 5473, which I believe is not always offered, is Network Security. And there‚Äôs a malware analysis seminar that‚Äôs being launched in the spring. Really only about nine credit hours of roughly 80 CSE major-related credit hours will be cybersecurity related. 

If I were in your shoes, I‚Äôd rather enroll in a cybersecurity bootcamp and do independent projects with hack the box or CTFs, or maybe get a shorter cybersecurity degree from a community college, than spend 3-4 years earning a degree where maybe 15% of it is going to teach me skills that would be relevant to my desired career path.",2,1,OSU,1,0,1731256615.0,1278

I think the solution to all the addictive issues we have: alcohol, drugs, food, gaming, gambling, arguing/anger, sex; literally any means of escapism; is treatment. Prevention would be best in the first place, but as a society we cannot agree how that pans out. The religious folk think that religion keeps people walking a straight line.

This is from ChatGPT  
Yes, during the 19th century in Russia, vodka was indeed made widely available and relatively inexpensive, partly as a state policy. The Russian government, especially under the Tsars, controlled and heavily taxed vodka production and sales to generate significant state revenue. This helped ensure that vodka was a staple of Russian life, often within reach of even the poorest citizens.

Regarding the bottles, it is true that vodka was frequently sold in ways that encouraged immediate consumption. Many vodka containers at the time were deliberately designed to lack resealable options, like corks, once opened. This was partly cultural, as vodka was often consumed communally and in social settings where the idea of saving a bottle for later wasn't common practice. Moreover, it served as a means to ensure that people consumed it on the spot, potentially leading to greater sales over time. This design choice also aligned with Russia‚Äôs broader tradition of vodka consumption and the societal norms around sharing drinks.",3,2,stopdrinking,2,0,1731244637.0,1151

"I don't know that there was a wow moment in the video. The intro was really pretty effective setup and hook. I had no idea the early communist movements had temperance underpinnings. And then how the various leaders manipulated it. Thought the oligarch mention did a good job bridging the historical gap and reinforcing the usp/golden thread. I thought the Purdue analogy was a little forced (or maybe heavy handed)? The whole of the video was factual, but then the very end got a little moralizing, which felt slightly out of place. And I guess if I'm nitpicking (which great producers do) the toggle between illustration and live action seemed a bit lazy? When I find myself doing something like this, it was usually me wanting to get something done rather than push myself to stay within the stylistic lines I'd established fort myself.

"Ap classes and rocketry are going to be your carry. There is no doubt you‚Äôre a strong candidate but so is everyone else. It comes down to essays really at this level. 

No school listed except UCF and Purdue are more than a blind shot at a target. It‚Äôs mainly CS that will weigh you just because there aren‚Äôt any CS focused ECs other than Roblox which is iffy. Understand your talking to adults and listing game development might not be translated as well as you intend. 

Your profile is more towards MechE and EE and you not being aligned with that is going to not weaken but rather not fully maximize what you have. We are all aware of the acceptance rates of these schools and it drops with CS since it‚Äôs so popular and trendy now. I‚Äôd say look into switching to ME or EE because it seems like you are already interested and switch or double CS which doubling at any of these schools is not feasible.

There's a handy little chart to give you an idea of what art school is. Essentially, you're looking at a negative return on investment in almost everything except graphic design.

"Art is the worst major in terms of a return on investment

According to the [Foundation For Research and Equal Opportunity ](https://freopp.org/whitepapers/does-college-pay-off-a-comprehensive-return-on-investment-analysis/#:~:text=young)analysis of the return on investment of over 30,000 degree programs  in the USA-- about 60% of all Art graduates are estimated to have a Negative return on investment- in other words after 30 years in the labor market 60% an art majors will still have less wealth then a high school graduates..  the Median art graduate can expect to make -100,000 less wealth in a life time then the typical high school graduate... 

however it  is not absolutely useless  about <1% do become policy writers, award winning journalists and well respected artists  . But those student probably grew up in the right zip codes , were well connected, and probably would have been successful regardless of their degree .  

  
I suggest you Pick Engineering, Computer science, Nursing or Accounting if you care about having a good job that pays well.  With the extra money you could always go back and study art- -- but if you get the art degree first.. its unlikely you'll be able to afford much of anything after that.

Do I regret it? Absolutely. But it was a unique experience.",0,1,conceptart,1,0,1731242361.0,352
"I have a lot to say regarding this topic, being that I DID go the art school route.

The short answer is NO, art school is not worth it. 

UNLESS, you can afford to potentially throw away $100k+, still be financially well off without landing a job in your field of study upon graduation, and can comfortably afford/don't mind going back to school for another degree if it doesn't work out (which it unfortunately doesn't, for most folks).

I graduated with a BFA in Game Art and while I worked my ass off through school (lots of sleepless nights, long hours, and now chronic back/wrist pain), I still count myself as extremely LUCKY to have had the job opportunities that I've had.

I now have about 5-6 years of industry experience working at AAA game studios and on projects for other high profile companies on my resume. BUT, this way of living is HARD. Most of my jobs have been contract; never knowing when/if I'll get another job is mentally and emotionally difficult ESPECIALLY if you're worrying about finances. 

And I count myself lucky because most of my friends (all of who I believe are fantastic artists, far more deserving than myself) haven't been able to get their foot in the door. Many of them now have student debt, need to work minimum wage jobs and/or go back to school and take on additional loans/debt, or spent years banging their heads against the doors to keep trying to land an industry job. 

I see people who graduated years ahead of me working minimum wage jobs with a LinkedIn profile that says they're still hoping to work in games/animation/illustration etc. and have been in that situation for about a decade now.

Yes, I have also seen people find great success in this field BUT it usually doesn't last. In the last 2 years, the layoffs have been absolutely insane. People with a decade or more experience laid off at AAA companies is not abnormal in this field, and probably far more common than others. What does that mean for people like us, who have little experience in comparison? üíÄ

Anyways, sorry for the rambling-- I'll get to the point.

Art school (as in, a 4 year degree program) is NOT worth it. You can give yourself a quality art education through much cheaper online resources/classes via YouTube, Schoolism, CGMA, CDA, Brainstorm, New Master's Academy, mentorships, etc. And combining it with in person workshops if they're available in your area, such as life drawing sessions or plein air painting etc.

Graphic Design, UI/UX, Motion Graphics, VFX, and Tech Art seem to have more job opportunity compared to Concept Art or 3D Environment/Character, but the art industry as a whole is far more volatile than others.

My personal recommendation is to pursue something stable first and do art on the side/pursue it after establishing a stable career/life. A degree doesn't matter in the art industry (no one has ever asked for my degree or where I went to school, and job apps rarely ask for this aside from art teacher positions at the college level or k-12 public schools), but is necessary for stable careers like medical, engineering, etc.

What sounds better? 

Having a reliable job with comfortable income and not needing to constantly stress about finances while pursuing art in your free time?

OR, paying $100k for an art degree, no work/inconsistent work with (probably) lesser pay, worrying about finances, paying off student loans on top of regular life expenses, potentially working a gig/minimum wage job on the side, and possibly needing to also go back to school for something more stable later and then being very behind on building a retirement fund? üíÄ

One more thing I should add, my biggest flaw as a working artist is exactly what you mentioned. I can be fast when I absolutely need to be, but being slow is the worst thing you can be as a working artist. 

I've had professors tell us repeatedly through school that someone who is fast but not as great of an artist is much more employable than someone who is a better artist but SLOW. This is especially true for contract work, which is paid hourly.

Biggest concern I saw was defensively the horizontal run game (outside zone, jet sweep, etc) were too successful on early downs and allowing Purdue to get to the edge and up field/ a wide kick out and cut up field for way to much positive yardage.

Last week we saw the bucks show up nicely against a more traditional power run game but with the zone/ misdirection stuff we‚Äôre still getting chewed up. 

Other concern was multiple under throws by Howard on wide open downfield receivers.

"Ohio State is overall a MUCH better team than Miami.  This is just the facts.  The level of pure talent that Howard has around him covers for a lot of his mistakes and shortcomings.  While I have seen Cam overthrow a deep ball, I have never seen him under throw a wide open receiver who was running free or barely covered 40 yards downfield.  Howard has done this in nearly every game this season.

While I like Howard for his leadership and toughness, and I‚Äôm glad that we have him, it would be insane for me or any reasonable person to believe that Howard is a better QB than Ward.

">coming from a small public high school with barely any extra curricular opportunities

FYI, there are many ECs that have nothing to do with your high school.

ECs are great, but, for Purdue, probably the most impactful thing you can do is get all As from here on out and get your test score up.

If your school has a robotics club I'd look into that.  If not, you could maybe try to start one, but its a lot of work and you're already in the middle of your junior year, so maybe not enough time to get anything meaningful done before you have to apply.

In terms of what to do over the summer, just working a part-time a job is likely to be more impactful than any paid summer program.

There are six SAT dates between now and when you'll need to apply.  I'd sign up for two or three of those.  If you plant to spend time prepping, then factor that in when making your summer plans.

Competitions- you might look into taking the AMC.  I'd approach whichever teacher is chair of your school's math department and see if they can make that happen.  Not super important though.

If you're not taking AP Calculus or AP Physics C right now, then, if your school offers one or both, try to sign up to take them next year.",0,2,ApplyingToCollege,2,0,1731156324.0,1216
"So I would take a step back.

Most of the top engineering programs in the US are at publics, not the sorts of private universities that dominate the US News ""T20"".  There is some overlap, like MIT, Caltech, Stanford, and Cornell.  But Purdue is a good example of a public engineering powerhouse not in the US News T20, and there are many more like Purdue.  And in fact if you are interested in privates, a lot of the most exciting ones to attend would be tech specialists along the lines of MIT--RPI, WPI, and so on.

This is good news for you because most of those engineering powerhouses are not really going to care that much about your ECs.  Indeed, I think what you already described is likely going to be fine.  On that subject, I highly recommend you carefully read and consider this article from MIT:

[https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying\_sideways/](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying_sideways/)

I think if you take that advice seriously, you will realize trying to belatedly check a bunch of boxes of activities other kids are doing is really not a productive use of your time.  Instead, I personally see an established focus on being a really valued person in your school and local community--the Kind club, the tutoring, and the local volunteering.  And I think you could just really keep focusing on that sort of thing.

But as another poster explained, what they ARE going to care about is your grades and (likely) test scores.  Indeed, here is the core of what that MIT article says:

* **Do well in school**. Take tough classes. Interrogate your beliefs and presumptions. Pursue knowledge with dogged precision. Because it is better to be educated and intelligent than not.
* **Be nice**. This cannot be overstated. Don‚Äôt be wanton or careless or cruel. Treat those around you with kindness. Help people. Contribute to your community.
* **Pursue your passion**. Find what you love, and do it. Maybe it‚Äôs a sport. Maybe it‚Äôs an instrument. Maybe it‚Äôs research. Maybe it‚Äôs being a leader in your community. Math. Baking. Napping. Hopscotch. Whatever it is, spend time on it. Immerse yourself in it. Enjoy it.

You are already doing the ""be nice"" and ""be a leader in your community"" parts.  So that leaves the ""do well in school"" part.

Of course this is just MIT, but I think you will find this approach works well for pretty much every engineering powerhouse.

As a final thought, this could also potentially help you accomplish something else--reduce the cost of your engineering degree.  Like, there is merit available from some good engineering schools.  Might be worth going after.

But institutional merit is primarily numbers driven, so the same advice applies.",0,1,ApplyingToCollege,1,0,1731158322.0,2706

"Sure!

As mentioned, Purdue is easily one of the biggest and most exciting engineering powerhouses in the US.  Just to expand a bit on what I mean by powerhouses being exciting, I don't think size is the only thing that matters in engineering programs, but I do think there are a variety of what I would call economies of scale available.  So a program like Purdue just has so much in terms of different electives and majors, different stuff to play with, different clubs, and so on.  Accordingly, lots of engineering kids I know have ended up really loving Purdue because to them it is like a big engineering theme park full of cool stuff.

The other publics I would identify as being powerhouses would at least include (and in no particular order, I am kinda just wandering around geographically) TAMU and Texas and Texas Tech, Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, NC State, Auburn, Clemson, 'Bama and Huntsville, Mississippi State, Florida and Central Florida, Maryland, Delaware, Rutgers and NJIT, Buffalo, Penn State and Pitt, West Virginia, UTK, Michigan and Michigan State and Michigan Tech, Illinois and UIC, Ohio State and Cincinnati, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa State, Missouri S&T, Colorado and Mines, Arizona State, Washington, Oregon State, Cal Berkeley, UCLA, Irvine, and San Diego, Cal Poly SLO, Cal Poly Po, San Jose State, and San Diego State.

I can feel I am missing some--like I lose track of all the engineering powerhouses in the California system.  But that's a least a good start.  There are also many, many more great engineering programs at a variety of publics, but I am trying to draw an arbitrary line around what I would consider to be the biggest/most-exciting powerhouse options.

Of course that is way too many to consider them all, but that is kinda the point.  Lots of states have put lots of money into developing one or more excellent public engineering colleges, because they see that as so vital to their state's educational and economic interests.

OK, so as a practical matter, you can start filtering.

You can look at cost, of course, and again check out merit.  Like, Iowa State is a really great engineering college has transparent admissions AND transparent merit.  I believe Minnesota's Net Price Calculator will actually tell you the merit you qualify for.  And so on.

You could look at regions.  Again because this is such a priority, every region has lots of options, including usually some that are more selective and some less.

Realistically, a lot of kids transfer out of engineering.  So you could look at colleges where you would still be happy with your Plan B options.

If you have any particular engineering interests, some are particularly strong and/or industry connected in some areas.

You could consider sports, campus life, or the campus setting.

"I get what you're saying, TAMU for example has a 12% acceptance rate, so even though I totally agree their profile is good enough for that 12%, it's not safe exactly, because they just don't accept that many people, so probabilistically you can't just assume it to be an automatic accept, which a safe university is more or less supposed to be.

Same for NCSU, since it's a state university, outside state admit rates can be low, basically 10-15% ish, which for this profile are realistic, but not safe category regardless, just by probability.  
  
I do understand what you're saying in essence though and yeah, with this profile, they'd get in one of the otherwise ambitious universities if they apply to multiple anyway, so they don't need a safe choice exactly.

They did mention money is not an obstacle for them exactly, and USC is not that bad really, it is kind of good if you can afford it, of course, the average USC student is richer usually.",2,2,MSCS,2,0,1731186797.0,953

The main Question right now without GRE is How good is your SOP? Is it showing you are just another engineer or you are able to portrait yourself as someone unique?

I would suggest you should surely focus a lot on that Because eventually thats what will Impress them.

"You will not get TA/RA opportunities right away. How will a prof know you‚Äôre any good ? Why should he/she award you a research  assistantship without seeing any results or your capabilities. Equally, why should a prof recommend you to the dept for a teaching assistantship without knowing your abilities. That is not how it works. Some profs may have funding for their research projects. You will need identify them, see what they are working on, find out if you‚Äôre interested in that field. You will need to go there, join a prof‚Äôs research group, work with him/her, produce output as expected with your research and then hope for a TA/RA. In many schools, profs will ask you to take one or two of their classes, score an A and then consider adding you to their research group. All of this usually takes a couple of semesters. Also, be clear eyed. All the schools you‚Äôve mentioned have huge Indian student populations. All of them will be in the same boat you are in. All of them want the same things you want. Therefore, everyone will be angling for that RA/TA. All of them are already there and trying for some time already. You‚Äôre only gonna join now.

Today‚Äôs Pick: Alabama Crimson Tide -2.5 -110

We begin in the SEC with one of my favorite scenarios. The ole‚Äô better qb & better coach theory. One side of the ball you have brian kelly & grant nutsmeers. The other, you have a coach who took udub to the natty last year & beat texas. Along with M.M.O.M

My Money On Milroe! 

No brainer here for me. Great number & even better spot. These two teams are trending in opposite directions. Bama coming off pitching a shut out. And lsu losing by three scores to a&m. Who just got shlacked by south carolina. The Tide Trio run game of Haynes, Jam & Milroe is lethal. And what is one thing the tigers love to give up?

"**CFB Week 11 Saturday Picks and Bets**

As Week 11 of college football heats up, fans and bettors are gearing up for multiple intense matchups. Key showdowns, including Georgia vs. Ole Miss and Alabama vs. LSU, feature in our predictions. Here, we‚Äôll cover the best picks, including the total points for each game and a prop bet on Garrett Nussmeier‚Äôs passing yards. Let‚Äôs dive in.

**CFB Week 11 Predictions**

* **Georgia vs. Ole Miss:** Under 55 Total Points (-110)
* **Alabama vs. LSU:** Over 58 Total Points (-112)
* **Alabama vs. LSU:** Garrett Nussmeier 325+ Passing Yards (+200)

**PICK #1: Georgia vs. Ole Miss Under 55 Total Points (-110)**

While Ole Miss has averaged 37.9 points per game, this contest against Georgia presents one of its toughest defensive challenges. Georgia ranks sixth in the nation in third-down stops, allowing just a 28% conversion rate, and the total has gone Under in five of eight games this season. This defensive strength, coupled with Carson Beck‚Äôs struggles under pressure ‚Äì where his completion rate plummets to 36% with an 8.5% interception rate ‚Äì signals a potential for fewer big plays. Ole Miss ranks fourth nationally in pressure rate and will likely force Georgia into a more conservative, run-heavy approach, aimed at limiting Beck‚Äôs exposure to mistakes.

Ole Miss‚Äôs offense has also shown vulnerability against strong SEC defenses, as its explosive play rate has dropped from 29.4% in non-conference games to just 13.9% in SEC matchups. With leading rusher Harry Parrish Jr. sidelined and top receiver Tre Harris not at full strength, Ole Miss may struggle to sustain its usual offensive tempo against Georgia‚Äôs 19th-ranked defense in explosive play prevention. Georgia‚Äôs disciplined defense and Ole Miss‚Äôs historical struggles against elite defenses point to a controlled, low-scoring affair, making the under a solid play in this clash of SEC contenders.

**PICK #2: Alabama vs. LSU Over 58 Total Points (-112)**

This matchup brings two high-powered offenses against secondaries that have struggled all season, setting the stage for a high-scoring game. Alabama‚Äôs secondary has shown vulnerability, and LSU‚Äôs passing attack could exploit this, especially with talented receivers like Kyren Lacy and Aaron Anderson ready to take advantage of mismatches. LSU ranks 118th in rushing success rate and 89th in EPA, so they will likely lean on its passing game against Alabama‚Äôs 14th-ranked blitz rate. This approach could force quick scoring drives or big plays, keeping the tempo high and the clock frequently stopped.

Alabama‚Äôs offense, led by Jalen Milroe, has been most effective when he uses his dual-threat abilities to make plays. LSU‚Äôs defensive woes, combined with Milroe‚Äôs ability to extend plays, should create explosive opportunities for Alabama‚Äôs offense. With both teams struggling defensively against the pass and consistently surpassing the total when facing potent offenses, the Over, at 58.5 points, offers value in what promises to be a high-scoring showdown in a high-stakes environment.

**PICK #3: Garrett Nussmeier 325+ Passing Yards**

LSU‚Äôs Garrett Nussmeier is well-positioned to exceed 325 passing yards against an Alabama defense that‚Äôs struggled against high-octane passing attacks. With LSU‚Äôs leading rusher yet to surpass 400 yards this season, Nussmeier will likely shoulder the offensive load and take advantage of Alabama‚Äôs secondary, which has been susceptible to big plays.

Additionally, Alabama‚Äôs defense relies heavily on blitzing, ranking 14th in blitz rate nationally.¬†

While this pressure often rattles quarterbacks, Nussmeier has been efficient against the blitz, showing a 10.5% touchdown rate when facing pressure. This suggests he could thrive in quick-hit passing situations, especially given his receiving corps, which is built to stretch the field and exploit Alabama‚Äôs reliance on man coverage. Nussmeier‚Äôs ability to stay poised under pressure and LSU‚Äôs reliance on the deep ball are ideal conditions for a high-passing yardage performance.",0,7,sportsbook,7,0,1731126314.0,4045

"2024 Record: 128-119-7 -3.8U

Yesterdays Picks:

Wake +7 L (last second touchdown again!)
Rice +7 Push
Cal UCLA u45.5 W

Saturday

Alright guys, I am feeling a big fucking day today. Time to get back to the green

Ohio St Purdue u 54.5

Ohio St has gone over this total four times. W Mich, Akron, Marshall, and Oregon. While Purdue sucks they aren‚Äôt a MAC team, but they also certainly aren‚Äôt Oregon. Think Ohio st pounds them, and I don‚Äôt really see the boilermakers scoring at all, and don‚Äôt see the buckeyes scoring 50+. 

GT +9.5

I think Haynes King will be back which is big for the yellow jackets. Miamis defense is questionable and I think the jackets can stay within a td in a shootout

Florida +22

Everyone on the longhorns, but my guy Billy just got a vote of confidence (maybe to steady the team before Sark and the boys blow their doors off but I digress). I think Lagway has enough playmaking to manufacture a few scores and keep this close enough.

Minnesota -6.5

Gophers have really turned it around. I was late last week but have caught up now. Rutgers is going the opposite direction. Think Minnesota rolls

BC -2.5

This one is a little stinky. So as always I‚Äôll dive right in. Last time I bet on cuse their first three drives ended in two pick sixes and another pick. I‚Äôm still scarred. Meanwhile my boy Tommy Castellanos has had enough moxy to cover me a few games and I‚Äôll stick with him here

WVU +4

Neers have been a tough team for me to get a hold of this year. Just when I decided they suck they beat Arizona on the road. Yes Arizona has been exposed as a a fraud but I just can‚Äôt quite buy in on this bearkats team yet either. Think wvu keeps it close enough.

Tex St -9

Preseason expectations may have just been wrong on Texas st. They were supposed to be a fringe g5 contender. That said 4-4 team that has some talent favored by nearly ten over a 5-3 team stinks, and as you know we jump right in.

Ole Miss +1.5

This game determines whether the rebs make the playoffs in all likelihood. Stadium will be juiced and I think Lane works some magic. Hotty damn toddy

Michigan +14.5

I road psycho cig hard for the first few weeks. Last few I‚Äôve been betting wrongly on some regression. That being said I‚Äôm committed now and think maybe the Michigan D might be able to slow down the Hoosier juggernaut enough

Kansas +2.5

Farmageddon lite. Lost season for Kansas so this is pretty much all they have now. If this line was released preseason it‚Äôs prob close to Kansas -3.5. They‚Äôve had a rough year but I think the talent and coaching are still there and this week I think the motivation is there too

VT +6

Tech really pissed me off last week. Outgained cuse but lost in OT. Clemson is trying to keep fringe playoff hopes alive but when that enter sandman starts pumping in Blacksburg they‚Äôll know they‚Äôre cooked. Hokies make enough plays to keep it close

UNT +6

Mean green at home, vs an undefeated ranked army. What could go wrong? Public all over army, and I salute the troops, but today we‚Äôre rolling with the eagles.

JMU -15.5

Georgia st blows. James Madison offense can and has put up a lot of points. Dukes roll at home

TTU +4.5

Deion is a fraud until he‚Äôs not. He just isn‚Äôt in the might p12 anymore and gets to roll through toothless big 12. But Lubbock is no joke and TTU has enough ability that I‚Äôll back them at home

UTEP Kennesaw u 42.5

Don‚Äôt watch this game. I repeat don‚Äôt watch this game. But let‚Äôs make some money on it. Both of these teams suck ass. Both of their defenses have been scrappy at times. I have no clue who wins but I think at least one of them score less than 14 and neither of them score more than 28, so it‚Äôs going under.

Vandy +6.5

The disrespect of the Dores continues. This one‚Äôs in Nashville. Pavia is probable, and will play. Anchor the fuck down.

Jax St -10

LT is offensively challenged, and rich rod and the boys roll teams and have been super hot in conference play. I‚Äôll ride the hot team.

Maryland +23

Long road trip - check. Less talent - check. Maryland might get smoked in Autzen. But I‚Äôm gonna just take the contrarian angle and bet this is a few too many points. Billy the kid Edwards will work a little magic and get us there.

ASU -2.5

I‚Äôve said it many times. And it‚Äôs worked many times. Skatpack. Don‚Äôt need to say much more.

Florida St ND u42.5

I wanted to bet on the noles here. I really did. But they‚Äôve burned me one too many times. Instead I‚Äôll bet on their more competent side of the ball and the fact that they should be fired up to try and knock ND out of contention. 

LSU +2.5

Defraud hasn‚Äôt really overperformed in Tuscaloosa this year. And now we‚Äôre expecting him to go into a night game in the swamp and win? Not me

UW +13.5

Huskies have outgained their opponent in every game but one this year. Mix of bad luck, dumb penalties, and terrible red zone execution has made them 5-4 instead of 7-2 or better. Penn st is always overrated and I think they get exposed a bit in this one

UVA +7

Suspiciously short line for a 7-1 team at home against a 4-4 team. Colandrea is fighting for bowl eligibility and might surprise them here.

UNLV -12.5

Islands are tough place to play. But this team is well coached and has been rolling teams. Run game travels, and I think they run it down their throat.

Utah +3

Utes stink this year. But rivalry game, chance to spoil the soakers dream season in rice Eccles. I think whittingham will find a way 

Wazzu Utah St u69.5

Too many points.

I found immense value in it- though I did a Fine Art undergrad (because there were no good digital options within reach at the time) From the social aspect of being surrounded by people in similar situations and getting a lot of exposure to new things that I wouldn't have otherwise experienced. To the tutors, which, your mileage may vary immensely, I was lucky enough to have wonderful teachers.  
(I also have ADHD and they were quite accommodating. Its hardly uncommon in the creative industries.)

On the other hand, it can be very expensive depending on where you are in the world, and the value you get from it is in part how much effort you put in, but also on where you go, who the tutors are and if they're a good fit for you.

For connections, there are always events (in the Uk/Europe, atleast) like Playgrounds, Lightbox exp, Animex etc, that offer a day or two of portfolio reviews, artist demos, industry talks and presentations, with networking events attached, I have personally gotten more from those in the networking aspect than from university.

4- Furst is still talented, I just think he‚Äôs going to be a 10-15 minutes guy and hope he can make those really valuable. Also dare I say this was Bergs best game? He looked way more like a basketball player today.

Don‚Äôt allow your parent(s) to dictate adult decisions, but build a healthy relationship with your parent(s) to discuss issues.

"- FCC is a purely American thing, the rest of the world doesn't care.
- ASTS has what, 40-50? contracts already lined up with some really concrete ones.
- ASTS IS better and cheaper which does help.
- ASTS is only a year away from a full constellation for the US, and thus being fully operational. A year is nothing.
- There will be an uproar worldwide if Starlink starts interfering with about every signal out there. They will get shut down and buried in lawsuits soon enough.

So yeah, they've gotten some cheap publicity with the hurricane stuff, but that's about it.

Main Street in downtown Lafayette is a nice place to walk around and has several good restaurants. Colombian Park is also nice,0,15,lafayette,15,0,1731096767.0,126
"When you say downtown, do you mean downtown Lafayette or somewhere in West Lafayette? I'd say that downtown Lafayette will have the greatest concentration of restaurants/shops if you basically just go up and down Main Street. On the Purdue side (West Lafayette), there's stuff on State Street like Vons Bookstore, as well as some things in the surrounding streets.

Food wise on the Lafayette side, you can consider:

* Bistro 501 if you're looking for something fancier

* East End Grill for a nicer, yet traditional place for American fare

* Yatagarasu for ramen

* Red Seven for a more modern American sit down restaurant

* Black Sparrow has a mixture of food types and has sort of a upscale but divey feel

* Revolution BBQ if you're in the mood for bbq; also really good craft cocktails (obviously not for your teen daughter though heh)

* Nom Nom Tacos if you want Mexican food

* The Bryant - this one is in West Lafayette and you'll need to drive there. Another nicer sit down modern American restaurant

"Basically, you submit a recording to colleges as part of your application, in some cases accompanied by a music resume, short essay about your music experience, and/or LOR from a music teacher or mentor.

The exact requirements can vary by college, but usually they want about 10 minutes of 2-3 pieces showing varied styles.

The Admissions office will usually send your music supplement to the Music Dept, and ensemble faculty and/or instrumental faculty will check it out. If you‚Äôre good enough to make All-State ensembles and win music competitions, etc, you‚Äôre the kind of student musician that this is designed for!

Basically, it‚Äôs a way for the AOs to know what kind of musical talent and skill you have, beyond what they can tell from your Activities List.

There‚Äôs a good episode of the Yale Admissions podcast that discusses it (‚ÄúSupplementary Materials,‚Äù from 2020). At Yale, the rankings that music faculty can give to applicants range from 1= ‚Äúno special consideration‚Äù (not good enough for campus ensembles), to 3 = good enough to be an asset to campus ensembles, to 5 = good enough to also be admitted to top conservatories like Juilliard.

Be aware that in a few cases, the deadlines are different for students submitting an Arts Supplement ‚Äî for example, Stanford requires apps to be submitted 15 days early. Check the websites for each school on your list individually.

I‚Äôm now a private admissions consultant, but I back when I was applying to colleges I was a serious music student, as were my two sisters. We had the stats to accompany our apps to T10s, but between the three of us we actually didn‚Äôt have a single college rejection! I know that music helped me get into Princeton. I‚Äôm always happy to help other student musicians learn more about how to make the most of their background in the arts.",2,4,ApplyingToCollege,4,0,1731099652.0,1823

"Oh also, totally fine to only apply to top ranked schools, just know that there is a realistic chance you may not get an offer at all because of how competitive they are",3,1,gradadmissions,1,0,1731087691.0,169
"I see what you mean, thank you for answering again. Even then though, I should still apply right? As in there is a good chance that I could still get an offer. Also, do you think I should be that worried about GPA where I would retake classes? Thank you and sorry if I am asking too many questions",4,1,gradadmissions,1,0,1731089074.0,297
"No worries! But yes, of course you should apply! Sorry if that wasn‚Äôt clear, it never hurts to try. I don‚Äôt think you need to retake any classes tho, but if you feel like a certain grade or two doesn‚Äôt represent your best knowledge, that‚Äôs up to you.",5,1,gradadmissions,1,0,1731090529.0,250
