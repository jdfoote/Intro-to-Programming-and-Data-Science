    "## Approaches for dealing with missing dictionary keys\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern of either modifying an existing dictionary entry or creating a new key is very common, and there are a few approaches for handling it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first is what I did above - using an if statement to check if the entry exists, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if letter in letter_dict:\n",
    "    letter_dict[letter] = letter_dict[letter] + 1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    letter_dict[letter] = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A very similar approach is used below: instead of `if`, we use a `try...except` clause, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    letter_dict[letter] = letter_dict[letter] + 1\n",
    "except keyError:\n",
    "    letter_dict[letter] = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A shorter, but slightly less readable approach is to use the `get` method of a dictionary. In the code below, `letter_dict.get(letter, 0)` will return the value for the key `letter` if it exists, or it will return `0` if the key doesn't exist \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "letter_dict[letter] = letter_dict.get(letter, 0) + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, the `collections` package has a [defualtdict](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict) which lets you create a dictionary with a built in default.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import collections\n",
    "letter_dict = collections.defaultdict(int)\n",
    "...\n",
    "letter_dict[letter] = letter_dict[letter] + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For most things in python, the language tries to have one right way to do things. In this case, I think that any of these options are just fine and are basically equivalent. Use whichever makes the most sense to you."
