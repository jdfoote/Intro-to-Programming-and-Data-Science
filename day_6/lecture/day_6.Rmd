## Paper Discussion

Shaw, A., & Hill, B. M. (2014). Laboratories of oligarchy? How the iron law extends to peer production. Journal of Communication.

## The Iron Law of Oligarchy

> - As organizations become more complex, a small group of early members gain and exercise power
> - But this shouldn't be true in online organizations, right?
>	- Almost definitionally democratic
>	- Anyone can contribute at any time
>	- Contributors are volunteers without "real" power
>	- Technology-mediated communication &rarr; flatter organizations

## The study

> - Looking at large wikis over time:
>	- H1: The probability of adding new administrators declines as contributor base grows
>	- H2: Administrators will contribute more to administrative pages as wiki grows
>	- H3: Reverts of experienced contributors' edits will grow as wiki grows
