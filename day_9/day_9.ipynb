    "\n",
    "When getting data from APIs, I strongly suggest following a three-step workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write some code that gets data from an API and saves all of the data (if possible) to a file\n",
    "2. Write a second program (usually a second file) that loads the data from the API, extracts the data that will be useful for analysis, and saves it in a flat file (typically a CSV).\n",
    "3. Program number 3 loads the CSV file and does the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has a few important benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most important is that often it is difficult to get the same raw data again. If you are using Twitter, then the Search API only lets you get the last week. If you are doing analysis a month down the road and decide that you really wish you had saved metadata about the number of retweets, it is too late. By saving the raw data you can change your measures or analysis strategy and still have access to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is that this gives you a nice pipeline, with intermediate files. Instead of including the entire raw data file in the code that does analysis, you only have to load the CSV, which is often much smaller and easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brief lesson will show an example of this workflow, using `tweepy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I'm going to put everything in one file for convenience, but my typical workflow is to put these in separate files and then run each file separately."
