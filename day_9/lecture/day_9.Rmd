## Dad Joke

My neighbor had the nerve to ring my doorbell at 3 o'clock in the morning.

# Ethics Discussion

Vitak, J., Shilton, K., & Ashktorab, Z. (2016). Beyond the Belmont Principles: Ethical Challenges, Practices, and Beliefs in the Online Data Research Community. Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing, 941â€“953.

## Working with online data

> - Save the raw data
> - Make your process reproducible

## Limitations of online data

> - Found, not made
> - Missing (sometimes invisibly)
> - Can result from changing/hidden processes

# Code Challenge Review



## Ethics in online data
> - Some dangers
>	- Privacy
>	- Transparency
>	  - Data is "exhaust" and people may not know it exists
>	  - What is "public" data? Expected audiences may differ greatly
>	  - Informed consent is difficult
>	- Unintended consequences
>	  - Data can be aggregated or used by bad actors
>	  - Salganik gives 18 examples of states using population data for genocide/forced migration

## Ethics in online data
> - More dangers!
>	- Data release
>	  - Data can be "de-anonymized"
>	  - NYC taxi data
>	  - ZIP + birthdate + gender is enough for ~1/3 of people
>	- Generalization
>	  - Twitter users != all people
>	  - Most active users != all users

## Balance is needed

What are the dangers of too much caution?
> - Emotional contagion as example case

## Some principles

> - Respect for persons, beneficence, justice, respect for law, and public interest
> - Think through possible harms to participants and the systems
> - Do work that has benefits
> - Consult with others
> - Assume that data is sensitive
> - Aggregate when possible
> - Notify participants of data collection and obtain consent when possible
> - Alter quotes/usernames
> - Share research with participants
