    "\n",
    "Once you have an account, you will need to create a new app at https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard and generate a \"bearer token\" from the app. Copy the bearer token to your clipboard and paste it into a new file in the same directory as this file, called `twitter_authentication.py`. The entire contents of the file should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bearer_token = \"YOUR BEARER TOKEN HERE\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you should **never** share this token with anyone else. If, for example, you are saving your work in a Git repository, make sure that you add the `twitter_authentication.py` file to your `.gitignore`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If anyone gets this token, they will have access to your Twitter account and you will need to revoke the token (from the same interface where you created it).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've created the file successfully, then the following two blocks of code should work."
